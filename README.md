# HPC final project
## Required task
`Develop a hybrid parallel computing project using OpenMP and MPI to accelerate image processing algorithms. Select a complex image processing task such as image segmentation, feature extraction, or image filtering. Implement the algorithm using OpenMP to parallelize computations within shared-memory environments (multi-core processors) and MPI for distributed-memory parallelization across multiple nodes. Evaluate the performance gains achieved by the hybrid parallelization approach and compare them with purely OpenMP and MPI implementations. Discuss load balancing strategies, communication overhead, and any optimizations applied to enhance the overall performance. Provide a comprehensive analysis of the scalability and efficiency of the hybrid parallelization, considering different input sizes and hardware configurations.`
